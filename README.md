## Course Info
* **CSC 120 - Computing Fundamentals I**

Welcome to CSC 120: Computing Fundamentals I! This course is your gateway to understanding the
foundational principles of computer programming and computational thinking. These skills are highly sought after
in today’s technology-driven world and will prepare you for future coursework, internships, and careers in fields
ranging from software development to data science. By learning to write and debug code, solve problems
systematically, and think like a computer scientist, you’ll gain tools that are applicable across many industries and
academic disciplines. Whether your goal is to create applications, analyze data, or simply enhance your problem-
solving skills, this class is a vital first step on your journey.

I am GLAD you are here, as this course is the beginning of a journey where you will develop computational thinking skills, and the ability to develop software. These skills can take you a long way academically and professionally. We start at the beginning in this course and learn foundational skills that will apply to future computer science course. We do a LOT of HANDS-ON and ACTIVE LEARNING using a friendly pseudocode language that we run in a simulator.  The simulator is built into the highly interactive online textbook, which follows a pattern of providing a little bit of text/explanation, then some hands-on learning with feedback, and then more text/explanation, etc. There are LOTS of opportunities to MAKE MISTAKES and LEARN from those mistakes, and then to DEMONSTRATE MASTERY by working to make the corrections showing that you have learned. MISTAKES are GOOD as that is how we learn.
